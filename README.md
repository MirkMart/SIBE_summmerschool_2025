# SIBE_summmerschool_2025

Hi everyone and welcome. This is the repository of the very first part of the SIBE Summer School 2025 held in Ferrara. Here, we collected information and support material to go through the introduction of the UNIX system and of GitHub.

Before starting here are a couple of definition that should be clear:

- A **terminal** is a program or interface you use to access the shell.
- A **shell** is a command-line interface (CLI), a program that interprets commands and sends them to the operating system.
- **Bash** is a shell and scripting language used in Unix like environment.
- **Unix** is a family of operating systems (comprising Linux and Mac).

A very interesting and complete book that we suggest you when approaching bioinformatic is [Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://womengovtcollegevisakha.ac.in/departments/Bioinformatics%20Data%20Skills%20Reproducible%20and%20Robust%20Research%20with%20Open%20Source%20Tools%20by%20Vince%20Buffalo.pdf) by Vince Buffalo. It is rich in suggestions, tips, and good practices to start and develop strong bioinfomatic skills. It is a resource where even people with experience can find something interesting and useful. We warmly suggest to read the first chapter of such book the first chapter and the first paragraph of the thid chapter.
